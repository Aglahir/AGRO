# AGRO COMPILER

## FIFTH DELIVERY 

This version includes the modular functionality for functions (declaration and call) and the needed new operation codes (era, gosub, endfunc and return [and their classes]) for the correct creation of all the needed quads.

## TODO
* Cleanup the cube class
* Check representation of memory addresses
* Error handling 
* Create classes for quads that use less than 4 parameters in code generation for cleanup
* Implement special math operators
* Add function call to the assign 
* Create more test files
