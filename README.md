# AGRO COMPILER

## SEVENTH DELIVERYYY

In this version, we added all the array logic to the quad generation, changed back the operators to string, in order to help our VM, that is
already in development.
Also, we validated some errors in compilation (use of non-declared vars)



## TODO
* Error handling (Ask for second dim in 1-dim array)
* Finish virtual machine
