## SECOND DELIVERY 2

This version includes changes in grammar according to a basic variable, function and object declaration. We have created a SymbolTable class that implements an infinite recursive linear scope, in which every scope has a pointer to it's parent scope. 

## TODO

* Explore code generation and memory in general to store variable values, class contents, function content, and object content.
